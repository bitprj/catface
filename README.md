# catface
Lambda Open-CV Cat Face Finder

This is an example OpenCV AWS Lambda function for finding cat faces. It is the code that this [Stoplight Scenario](https://app.stoplight.io/scenarios/collections/2Fm3KKS53RP48aT95/qpztuAqwpM32PQeuK?tab=overview) Invokes.

Also, I have uploaded node_modules and OpenCV with the compiled libraries.  It is a pain in the ass to compile OpenCV for AWS Lambda, so I have endured the pain so you don't have to. If you are interested in learning how to compile OpenCV for Lamdbda you can follow this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/nodejs-packages-in-lambda/).
